Lais Zagati's Resume Webpage

This is a single-page resume site that I built to showcase my skills, experience, and unique advantages as a junior developer in career transition. I wanted a design that effectively communicates my enthusiasm for learning and my dedication to transitioning into tech, while also providing a user-friendly experience for those exploring my profile.

How I Built This Project

HTML Structure: 

I designed the HTML layout with a clear structure to guide users from my name and role as a Full Stack Developer down through personal info, experience highlights, and reasons to hire me. Each section is organized for easy navigation, starting with a header, personal info sidebar, a "Why Hire Me?" section, and ending with a footer.

Responsive Design: 

Using Bootstrap, I created a responsive, mobile-friendly design that adjusts based on screen size. This way, potential employers can view my resume comfortably on any device. I included a mix of Bootstrap classes and custom CSS for flexibility and styling.

Iconography and Hover Effects: 

To add a professional touch, I incorporated Font Awesome icons alongside hover effects from the Hover.css library. These enhancements provide visual cues for actions like navigation and download options, making the site more interactive and polished.

Styling: 

Custom styles in style.css allow me to personalize the design to reflect my professional brand. For instance, the sections are color-coded (like the "bg-color-name-title" and "bg-color-three-reasons" classes) to create visual variety and separate content areas.

Footer with Download and Social Links: 

To keep the resume practical, I added a footer with download and social links so that visitors can easily access a PDF version of my CV or find me on GitHub and LinkedIn. This section improves accessibility and makes it simpler for users to engage with my profile.


This project is an evolving resume site that showcases my development journey, focusing on both my technical skills and my proactive, adaptable approach as a developer in transition.
